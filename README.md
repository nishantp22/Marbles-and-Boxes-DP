A and B are playing a game of boxes and marbles. There are n marbles (numbered $1$ to $n$) and n boxes (numbered $1$ to $n$) kept on the ground. A is dropping all the marbles at once and trying to see which marble falls into which box. However, gravity is acting strangely, and it is confirmed that after you drop the marbles in boxes, there will be only one marble in each box.<br>  
The rules of the game are as follows: B will win if there is not even a single box whose number matches with the marble it contains, or there is exactly one box whose number matches with the marble it contains. If neither of the above happens, A will win.
Given that A decides the number of marbles and boxes (value of $n$), can you find the number of ways in which B can win?<br>
Input: the integer $n$.
Output: The number of ways in which B can win
Constraints: $1$ <= $n$ <= $10^8$
